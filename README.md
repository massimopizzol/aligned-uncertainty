# aligned-uncertainty
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for performing **uncertainty analysis** as part of the **ALIGNED project** (WP1, Task 1.4).

## Overview
### üìÅ Notebooks-bw2.5
The `Notebooks-bw2.5` folder includes notebooks for uncertainty analysis and parametrized analyses using **Brightway 2.5**.

**Note:** [Brightway](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/index.html) is an open-source Python package for life cycle assessment (LCA), designed to work with large datasets and perform LCA calculations quickly and accurately.

Included Notebooks:
- ALIGNED-T1.4-Comparative-MC-tutorial.ipynb
    - Demonstrates how to perform a **Comparative Monte Carlo** uncertainty analysis.
- ALIGNED-T1.4-GSA-tutorial-corr.ipynb
    - Demonstrates how to perform **Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)** using the **correlation approach**.
- ALIGNED-T1.4-GSA-tutorial-FAST.ipynb
    - Demonstrates how to perform **Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)** using the **FAST method**.
- ALIGNED-T1.4-Model-Uncertainty-tutorial.ipynb
    - Demonstrates how to perform **uncertainty analysis** and quantify the uncertainty due to a **specific modelling choice**.
- ALIGNED-T1.4-OAT-tutorial.ipynb
    - Demonstrates how to perform **One At a Time (OAT)** sensitivity analysis.
- `Parametrized_analysis` folder
